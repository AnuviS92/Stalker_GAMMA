		<text>You heard right stalker. I will give you some armors that are about the same kind than the one you have in your posession. 
		Remember that if your armor is in bad shape, I will not give you a prestine one eh? It's not Babushka's house here. 
		You give me a random pile of crap, I will give you a scavenged, rusty and smelly armor some of our stalkers brought the other day. 
		On the other hand, if your armor is in good shape, I will give you a shiny new outfit ok? 
		By the way, this service is not free. You can check the prices on the bilboard over there. Consider the cost as a fee for the whole service to run since we repair some of the armors, and as a donation for our faction to prosper. 
		So, which type of armor do you want to trade? I will check if you have an outfit matching what you seek.</text>
