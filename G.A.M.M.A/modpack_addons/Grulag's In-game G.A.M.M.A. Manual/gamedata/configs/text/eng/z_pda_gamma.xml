			%c[pda_white]How To Progress \n \n %c[ui_gray_1] 
			\nIn summary, the basics of G.A.M.M.A. progression are as follows:
			\n• Perform tasks, kill mutants, collect their parts, keep these parts to accomplish stalkers tasks. 
			\n• Collect stashes coordinates, visit those stashes (white or green icons on the PDA map), to get nice loot and toolkits.
			\n• Use the acquired toolkits to craft repair kits for guns and armors you found to improve your gear and chance of survival.
			\n• By completing tasks, earn goodwill for different factions and buy better supplies, including better ammo for your shiny new gun.

			\n• Use basic healing items like medkits or bandages to heal your main health; This heals your limbs temporarily (yellow HP).
			\n• To convert the temporary HP (yellow) to permanent HP (white) for your limbs, use post heal items such as Ibuprofen, Fentanyl, Antidot or Yadulin.
			\n• Any medicines with white dots in their description will heal the temporary HP for that limb or area. Such healing items have a white heart icon.
			\n• Post-healing will give you side effects such as extreme hungryness or strong dizziness. Dizziness can be cured using stamina boosting medicines or water.
			\n• Keep in mind that damage resistance injectors work (indicated by a shield icon).
			\n•	You don't need every medical items to heal your body. Mark the most important ones as favorite for an easy access.

			%c[pda_white]Radiation \n \n %c[ui_gray_1] 

			\n• GAMMA features dynamic radiations and revamped radiation damages system.
			\n• New random radiation patches are spawned when starting a new game.
			\n• Radiations will slowly reduce your health (much slower than Vanilla) and will reduce your max stamina. 
			\n• The more irradiated you are, the more probably critical organs will be damaged by rads. This results in the 
			\n player character coughing and loosing significant health amount.
			\n• The radiation meter bar is available at the bottom left corner of the screen. If it starts being filled, you just hit 
			\n a radiation patch, try to back track to avoid traversing it. Radiations can also come from artefacts that are not in a container.
			\n• Use an anti rad or cigarettes to cure the rads. Using rad protecting drugs is also a good way to avoid radiations.
			\n• The more to the north you go, the more dangerous the radiations will be. Be sure to have a good gas mask before going 
			\n into northern areas. Army Warehouses without a gas mask can kill you if you just hit one bad radiation patch without 
			\n proper anti radiation medication. Keep in mind that running into a strong radiation area will likely make you unable to move.

			\n• Unmarked stashes are almost always empty.
			\n• Stashes must be marked to contain anything, especially toolkits.
			\n• Stashes content is tied to the map they spawn in.
			\n• The northern a stash is in the Zone, the better the loot.
			\n• Expert toolkits can only be found after Red Forest and in the most northern areas of the Zone.
			\n• Storing stuff in stashes is safe : it won't be looted by NPCs.
			\n• Even if the stash is marked at some point, content will spawn in the stash on top of what you previously stored.

			\n• When attaching the patch, you need to be out of the field of view of other stalkers so your disguise doesn't blow up.
			\n• This feature is especially powerful with ecologists armors, but they are very hard to get your hands on in GAMMA.

			%c[pda_white]Lore \n \n %c[ui_gray_1] 

			\n After the fall of the Monolith thanks to Strelok, the Zone became a place of science and discoveries. 
			\n The zone wasn't a secret place anymore and the UN then started to ban armament selling in the Zone to make it more 
			\n peaceful, with paid PMCs ensuring the security of scientists and limiting fights between factions. 
			\n Indeed, the EU and UN decided to put a stop at the bloodshed in the Zone as well as guns smuggling 
			\n from the Zone to the nearby countries by trying to limit guns traffic, and no faction want to have 
			\n problems with more Private Military Companies paid by these organisms, PMCs are already crawling enough 
			\n within the Zone.
			\n 
			\n During that period of peace, new discoveries were made, such as artefacts melting, fusion and empowering thanks to the work of Prof. Sakharov.
			\n 
			\n This "Golden Age" of science in the Zone however made the existing factions weaker, and the Monolith was not a priority anymore.
			\n Deep down in the Zone and CNPP, the Monolith was secretly getting stronger, and a new group of fanatics, even crazier than the Monolith according to the rumors, started plotting in the dark.
			
			\n We are in 2018, the Golden Age of the Zone is finished, the Monolith is back. They reactivated the miracle machine and the brain 
			\n scorcher, and it's 2012 all over again. The weakened factions got softer and are not the hardened Monolith killer that they were back in the days.
			\n The only hope of most stalkers? Finding Strelok. Some rumors are hinting that he's potentially still alive, and the Doc, one of his old friend, might have some leads concerning his location.
			\n 
			\n Your character arrives in the Zone in the middle of that mess, and you are tasked to find Strelok and help cleaning the Zone from the Monolith scourge.

			%c[pda_white]Money \n \n %c[ui_gray_1] 

			\n In GAMMA money is of the essence, especially in the beginning. 
			\n There are fast ways to make cash, namely doing tasks without picking up fights, selling mutant parts or selling 
			\n artefacts to the ecologists.
			\n
			\n You'll find yourself often spending money in healing items and that's intended. The more you play, the better 
			\n the toolkits you'll have and the easier it will be to repair good gear and craft items, which will save money 
			\n and make fights easier, thus helping you saving even more money.
			\n 
			\n In mid game, you'll inevitably get loads of money. This can be used to upgrade your equipment, or invest in 
			\n expensive AP ammo.
			\n 			
			\n You can also buy detectors and NVGs at traders... Or craft them and save some money.
			\n Maintaining an exoskeleton armor will also be a money sink since you need to often buy expensive exo batteries 
			\n in numbers.
			\n 			
			\n Better healing items are also a must to have easier fights, using stimpacks will greatly help you in tense fights.

			\n Armor plates belt attachments are on par with artefacts protection, reaching about 15% ballistic and explosive protection. 
			\n They do not have electric res penalties anymore. They do not protect you from mutants anymore.
			\n Plates can't be bought at merchants anymore.
			\n Basic Kevlar armor plates are obtained via questlines (basic tier 1 plate) or crafted from scratch using armor parts.
			\n
			\n Armor plates can be upgraded via the crafting system:
			\n•      The tier 1 Kevlar plate can be upgraded to tier 2 Kevlar plate with lots of armor parts.
			\n•      The tier 2 Kevlar plate can be upgraded to tier 3 metallic plate with lots of armor parts.
			\n•      The tier 3 metallic plate can be upgraded to tier 4 metallic plate with lots of armor parts.
			\n
			\n This system should push the player to scavenge armor parts for longer.
			\n Armor parts used in this system are conveniently marked with a hammer and pincer icon for easy sorting and looting.
			\n This should prevent players that don't want to engage in artefacts hunting to not die miserably once they fight monolith 
			\n and sin in the north, which are exclusively using AP ammo.

			\n• New Grizzly Detector to find all artefacts even with NVGs on. Craftable with an advanced toolkit.
			\n
			\n• New artefacts spawning system: artefacts spawn randomly in the current map of the player, in anomalous fields so be
			\n sure to check them whenever you move around them!
			\n• Rare artefacts also respawn in the labs after emissions.
			\n
			\n• New artefacts quality system: artefacts spawn with a random low condition (or "quality") to mimic that every artefact 
			\n is different. With the new Artefacts Melter, you can combine artefacts to make them stronger and increase their quality.
			\n 
			\n%c[pda_yellow]New toolkit, the Artefacts Melter:%c[ui_gray_1]
			\n• Buy it at Sakharov or Herman for about 30k RU.
			\n• You can craft stronger artefacts (right click > Fuse Artefacts) or empower them (right click > Empower artefacts). 
			\n• Every action you take with the artefacts melter will consume some charges. 
			\n• You can refill the melter by holding Left Alt key and dragging it on top of any artefact.
			\n• Keeping an empty melter on you is a good way to replenish it on your way through the zone with unwanted artefacts.
			\n 
			\n%c[pda_yellow]Artefacts Empowering:%c[ui_gray_1]
			\n• Combine two exactly similar artefacts to sum their condition / quality. 
			\n• You can combine any junk artefact with any other junk artefact at a reduced rate.

			\n%c[pda_yellow]Artefacts Crafting:%c[ui_gray_1]
			\n• Access the craft menu as usual. There will be a new crafting subsection: Artefacts. 
			\n• This will allow you to convert multiple artefacts of a given tier to the tier above:
			\n• Junk > Tier 1 (7mS).
			\n• Tier 1 > Tier 2 (12mS).
			\n• Tier 2 > Tier 3 (23mS).

			\n Energy in GAMMA is a balancing act between travel, food, drinks, medicine and sleep.
			\n
			\n You character will be tired at the end of the day. You have to sleep to replenish your energy. 
			\n You can only sleep if you are tired enough. Using sleeping pills will allow you to forcefully
			\n sleep.
			\n
			\n Depending on how the day was, you'll get tired faster or not. Eating copious meals and using
			\n sleep inducing medicines will allow you to feel tired and get rest at the end of the day. 
			\n 
			\n However if you are eating small meals, and use energy drinks or caffeine tablets often, 
			\n you'll have a hard time to be tired enough to sleep at the end of the day.
			\n 
			\n You'll have a chance to wake up early. Be sure to try to sleep more than what you intend to 
			\n sleep the correct amount of time, or use better sleeping gear (matress and sleeping bag).
			\n 
			\n Vodka or Beers can help you sleep as well.

			\n The goodwill thresholds are:

			\n
			\n This is a reliable way to secure a steady income of quality ammunitions.
			\n
			\n Traders are either of the WP (Warsaw Pact) or NATO type. This will influence the kind of supplies they sell

			\n NATO factions: Mercenaries, Clear Sky, Freedom, UNISG.
			\n WP factions: Military, Loner, Duty, Bandits, Renegades, Monolith.
			\n 
			\n This also influences NPCs loadouts of factions, ie: Monolith NPCs have about 50% chance to have a NATO or WP gun.
			\n
			\n Some traders sell very specific items, like Prof. Sakharov and Hermann sell the Artefacts Melter, 
			\n a GAMMA specific toolkit that let's you empower and craft artefacts (and you can break artefacts with

			%c[pda_white]Repairs for Guns \n \n %c[ui_gray_1] 

			\n Guns must be repaired to progress since you can't buy them from traders with GAMMA Economy. 
			\n
			\n You can loot guns from stashes or dead stalkers though, and that's how you will make it to the North in one piece.
			\n Most guns will be destroyed and you'll need to fix them or they will jam very often.
			\n Keep in mind that gun's condition is separated from parts conditions. Gun condition represents how clean a gun is 
			\n and will change parts degradation and promote jamming. Jams are coming from the actual gun parts. Repairing the gun
			\n condition will not repair the gun's parts. Each part must be repaired individually. Each part affects the gun jamming 
			\n frequency. The barrel changes the damage the gun deals and the strength of ammo penetration.
			\n
			\n%c[pda_yellow]A gun with a very bad barrel condition will deal almost no damage, don't do that.%c[ui_gray_1]
			\n
			\n To repair guns you have two ways:
			\n
			\n - You can get the appropriate repair kit, right click the gun and "maintain parts" it will allow you to replace 
			\n the guns parts for 100% condition parts automatically, but will consume a repair kit use. It can even replace barrels. These 
			\n kits can be crafted or bought from mechanics once you have the appropriate toolkit (basic, advanced or expert). Replacing parts
		`	\n that way will improve the gun condition.
			\n - You can however still repair guns without the proper repair kits: 
			\n Collect parts above 60 condition and repair them with the appropriate tool to 100 condition
			\n (ramrod, Multitool... Check the part's details). Then simply drag and drop the repaired parts on the gun.
			\n Moving parts in and out of the gun will will make it less clean. Barrels can't be replaced that way.
			\n
			\n - If a gun has a barrel with a condition above 60% condition, you can buy a cleaning kit from mechanics and right click the 
			\n gun > clean barrel. Same for other parts. It's an easy way to get good guns early since you can buy cleaning kit without any
			\n toolkits unlocked.
			\n 
			\n
			\n You must also clean the gun using cleaning equipment or paying a mechanic to do it. Cleaning a gun will not repair its parts 
			\n but will prevent parts to be degraded when shooting.
