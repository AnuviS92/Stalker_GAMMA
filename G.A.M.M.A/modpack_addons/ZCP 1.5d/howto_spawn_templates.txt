Here's how to create a new spawn template for ZCP:

First, create a new .ltx file in configs\plugins\zcp\spawn_templates\, for example my_template.ltx. I recommend copying an existing file.
Spawn templates are made of sections that have the following format:

[<level>_tier<tier>_monsters]
<squad or group reference>
<squad or group reference>
...

Where:
- <level> is the level/map the section is for.
- <tier> is the mutant tier (1-3) the section is for.
- <squad or group reference> can be one of the following:
  - A squad name.
  - A squad name + weight in the format <squad> = <weight>
  - A group reference in the format *<file>*<section>

If you define a weight for a squad this will dictate how often it will spawn compared to other squads in that section. If no weight is defined, it will default to 1. For example:

[l03_agroprom_tier1_monsters]
simulation_boar = 3
simulation_flesh = 1.5
simulation_bloodsucker = 1.5
This will yield a 1/2 chance to spawn a boar, a 1/4 chance to spawn a flesh, and another 1/4 chance to spawn a bloodsucker.

Group references allow you to bundle together multiple squad names and reuse them without copy/pasting all of them.
The group section for a reference can be found in configs\plugins\zcp\spawn_groups\<file>.ltx under the section <section>.
For example, *default*all_tier1 would be found in configs\plugins\zcp\spawn_groups\default.ltx under the heading [all_tier1].
Just like creating new spawn templates you can create new group files and they'll be automatically read whenever you use them in a group reference.

To put this together in an example:

-- in the template file:
[l03_agroprom_tier1_monsters]
simulation_boar
simulation_flesh
*my_groups*all_tier1

-- in configs\plugins\zcp\spawn_groups\my_groups.ltx
[all_tier1]
simulation_bloodsucker
simulation_psysucker

This would define tier 1 mutant spawns for Agroprom, consisting of the squads simulation_boar, simulation_flesh,
as well as the squads referenced in *my_groups*all_tier1 -- simulation_bloodsucker and simulation_psysucker.

After you've created your template it will automatically show up in ZCP.
