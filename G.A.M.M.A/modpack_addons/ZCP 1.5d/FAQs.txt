Zone Customization Project F.A.Q
---

Q: Story mode is not supported in ZCP, but how well does it work roughly?
A: From all reports I've read, no story mode related bugs have been reported. You are probably fine.

Q: What about warfare?
A: Warfare uses completely different spawn logic, and while ZCP will (reportedly) not break warfare, many options simply won't work.

Q: I have disabled certain mutants or factions, and they still appear?
A: Changing these options will not despawn already spawned stalkers/mutants. You will either have to wait for them to die off, or start a new game. Additionally, there are a few hand-placed special squads with unique names. ZCP does not touch these to be extra sure not to break anything. However, you should rarely encounter them.

Q: How do the options "Stalker squad size" and "Mutant squad size" work exactly?
A: You can think of the default value of 1 being the regular, unchanged squad size. If you set any other value, the squad size will get multiplied by it. For example:
- A squad size of 3 will lead to squads with triple the size of vanilla.
- A squad size of 0.5 will lead to squads half the size of vanilla.
It's also important to note that squad size is always random in Anomaly, sometimes the same squad will have three members, sometimes two for example.

Q: How does the option "Squad size variance" work exactly?
A: You can think of it as random multiplier on top of squad size. For example:
- A squad size of 1 and a variance of 0.5 will lead to squads between half the size and 1,5 times the size.
- A squad size of 2 and a variance of 1 will lead to squads between 1 and 3 times the size of vanilla.
In short, if you want to be surprised by randomly encountering unusally large or small squads, then you should increase variance.

Q: I'm not encountering very many mutants/stalkers, although my population factors are high?
A: There are multiple factors that could be at work:
- Disabling offline combat might help, this has nothing to do with ZCP though.
- You have set a high squad size variance and low squad size. This will lead to squads not being spawned since they'd have zero members.
- You have enabled zombie spawns. These might replace spawns and kill off stalkers.

Q: How do Spawn Templates work, and what are the options "Apply to random mutant spawns" and "Apply to replaced disabled mutant spawns" for?
A: You might have noticed there's no single "on" or "off" for spawn templates. This is because the two aforementioned options control when spawn templates are used.
- "Apply to random mutant spawns" will cause spawn templates to affect any mutants replaced through the "Spawn random mutant squads" option in the "Mutants" menu.
- "Apply to replaced disabled mutant spawns" will apply spawn templates to the random spawns that'll replace mutants disabled in the "Mutant Types" section of the "Mutants" menu. Additionally "Replace removed squads" needs to be checked in the same section, otherwise disabled mutants won't be replaced by anything.

Q: Does ZCP change AI behavior?
A: No, it does not change any code related to that. The one exception is the "Zombies seek player" option that mirrors behavior from survival mode.

Q: Does ZCP change how stalkers/mutants are spawned? I have noticed they seem to spawn on top of me, regardless of the exclusion radius I set.
A: No, ZCP uses the same code as vanilla to determine whether a squad can be spawned or the player is too close.

Q: My game crashes with an error in the log that contains "[error]Description   : Not enough IDs". Is ZCP responsible for this?
A: Yes and no. The game engine assigns IDs to every stalker, mutant, item, and so on. It has 65535 of such IDs available, after that you will run into this error. ZCP alone -- even on maxed out settings -- will not exhaust all of these IDs. However, if you use other addons that spawn lots of stalkers/mutants/items, have unreasonably massive stashes, or such things, then that will all contribute to less available IDs.
I recommend:
- If it happened in the middle of the game: Loading an earlier save and deleting player stashes, triggering an emission to kill off stalkers, and then taking the other suggested measures.
- Decreasing mutant/stalker population, squad size and squad variance
- Disabling other addons which spawn a lot of stalkers, mutants, and items.
This is an engine limitation, and as such there's nothing ZCP can do to fix it. However, the population settings have been chosen in a way where in normal gameplay even with all settings turned to max running out of IDs should not happen.
