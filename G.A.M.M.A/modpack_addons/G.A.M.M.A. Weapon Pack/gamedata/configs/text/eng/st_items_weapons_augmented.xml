	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_aug_a1_descr">
		<text>Chambered in 5.56x45 NATO. Steyr AUG A1 in standard Austrian Army rifle configuration (tan colour). The AUG is an Austrian bullpup designed in the 1960s by Steyr Mannlicher GmbH &amp; Co KG (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch).\n \n</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_aug_a2">
		<text>Steyr AUG A2</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_aug_a2_descr">
		<text>Chambered in 5.56x45 NATO. The AUG A2 is an improvement of the A1. One of the key differences is the replacement of the integral scope with a Picatinny rail, allowing all sorts of iron and reflex sights, as well as scopes, to be added. It is a common rifle to find in the black market, and a very reliable one.\n \n</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_aug_a3">
		<text>Steyr AUG A3</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_aug_a3_descr">
		<text>Chambered in 5.56x45 NATO. Steyr AUG A3 is a further improvement of both the A1 and A2. Having the same Picatinny Rail integration as the A2 in full-length, as well as coming with an external bolt release located above the magwell, the rifle is easily able to fit any ironsight or reflex sight, including any scope.\n \n</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_aug_thales">
		<text>Thales F90</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_aug_thales_descr">
		<text>Chambered in 5.56x45 NATO. The Thales F90, also known as the EF88, is an improvement of the Australian version of the AUG, the F88 Austeyr. Produced in 2012 and meant to replace the F88, this is the most modern AUG one can find, having a lot of improvements based on the performance of the F88 itself, which increases its ergonomics and reliability. The unique barrel gives it much better recoil control and accuracy, while the custom foregrip allows for better handling. An incredibly rare gun, brought in by some ex-Australian Spec Ops, for that the price is right.\n \n</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_aug_9mm">
		<text>Steyr AUG A3 9mm XS</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_aug_9mm_descr">
		<text>Chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum. Also known as the Steyr AUG Para. It comes with a different unique barrel, bolt and magazine, although a TMP magazine can fit with it. This weapon was made for, as the name would tell, Paratroopers. It is a reliable sub-machinegun, in bullpup format, which is why it's popular amongst Freedomers.\n \n</text>
