	<string id="st_wpn_beretta_m9_descr">
		<text>Chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum. This is the US Marine Corps version of the Italian Beretta 92FS, made by demands from said faction. Since it is famous around Mercenaries, Freedom and some strange mentioned recent faction, it's safe to say that the way this "semi-prototype" got in The Zone is through Western armies' deserters and ex-PMCs.\n \n</text>

		<text>Beretta Px4 Storm</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_beretta_px4_descr">
		<text>Chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum. The Px4 Storm is an advancement of the Beretta 8000, meant to be as a replacer of the 92FS for personal defense and law enforcement use. Its rotating barrel allows for better recoil control and continuous shots, the lightframe also helps with the weight. This particular model seems to come with tritium sights as well. From the looks of it, these weapons were "illegally" exported from Armenia and Romania, by mercenaries that used to be part of the police force from said countries.\n \n</text>
